# Dorayaki-cake-

This is Dorayaki cake recipe.
Dorayaki is a traditional japanese cake that is also famous by the name dora cake.
Dorayaki is a very old recipe and is made traditionally using redbean paste filling (azuki beans) , these redbeans are not available everywhere , so we will make it using hazelnut chocolate spread ;)

Dorayaki's history dates back to centuries . It was made during the time of Samurais and is very similar to the portuguese pan cake "Casthella".This is an influence from portuguese food, as Japan used to ruled by the portuguese during mid-sixteenth centuries !

I hope you loved it's history !

Let's start Baking then !

(P.S - These cakes have not been named Dora cakes after Doraemon , Instead the word Dorayaki means Gong,{a big bell} on which it was baked for the first time !!)
